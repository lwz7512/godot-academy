Reflex ships with a **Page** type. You can use a **page** to create a simple
text-based page or a complex landing page with [components](/docs/components) and [blocks](/docs/blocks).

## Add a page

To add a page, create a file in the `content/pages` directory. Example: `content/pages/about.mdx`.

<Callout my="8">
  You can use either <Strong>.mdx</Strong> or <Strong>.md</Strong> file
  extension. They both work.
</Callout>

A basic page looks like this.

```md title=content/pages/about.mdx
---
title: Welcome to Reflex
excerpt: Description for this page. This is mostly used for the description meta tag.
---

# Add your content here.
```

On save, Gatsby will automatically create a new page for you at `/about`.
