title: MDX
excerpt: MDX is the Markdown format extended to allows JSX components.
---

Reflex uses MDX for content. Pages, blocks, posts, and navs are all built using MDX. You can import components, such as blocks, and embed them within your content.

## Components

Components can be imported or written inline with your Markdown content.

```jsx
---
title: A page
---

import { Example } from "package" // highlight-line

# Heading 1

A paragraph officiis labore excepturi nam.

<Block src="hero" /> // highlight-line

Another paragraph.

<Button>A button</Button> component.
```

## Styling

Components in MDX files can be styled using style props.

```jsx
---
title: A page
---

<P color="primary">A paragraph in primary color</P>

<H3 mb="4">A heading with margin bottom</H3>
```

See the [Theme reference](/theme) for style props values.
