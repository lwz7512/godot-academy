excerpt: Using blocks in Reflex allows you to extract and group components into smaller re-usable chunks.

To move the hero we created into a block, start by adding a new block under `/content/blocks/hero.mdx` and move the
hero there.

```md title=content/blocks/hero.mdx
<Section p="4">
  <Container>
    <Grid col="1fr 250px" gap="8" alignItems="center">
      <Div>
        <H1 my="0" fontSize="4xl">
          Welcome to my site
        </H1>
        <P mt="4">This is the a short description for the page</P>
      </Div>
      <Image src="placeholder.jpg" />
    </Grid>
  </Container>
</Section>
```

You can now use the new block on the `about.mdx` page using the `Block` component.

```md title=content/pages/about.mdx
---
title: Welcome to Reflex
excerpt: Description for this page. This is mostly used for the description meta tag.
---

<Block src="hero" /> // highlight-line
```

<Callout my="8" pt="0" pb="2">

When adding a block to a page, you can omit the `/content/blocks` path prefix. Reflex will automatically resolve the block using the block name.

</Callout>

Blocks can also be nested in sub-directories and used as follows:

`<Block src="about/contact" />` will display the block found at `/content/blocks/about/contact`.

```
site
  └── content
      └── blocks
          └── about
              └── contact.mdx
```
