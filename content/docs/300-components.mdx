import { ThemeProvider } from "@reflexjs/gatsby-theme-core"
import { Callout } from "@reflexjs/gatsby-theme-doc"

## Installation

Components are provided by the `@reflexjs/components` package and is aleady included in the `base` starter.

[Learn how to use Reflex components in any React project](/blog/reflex-create-react-app).

## What is a component?

A component is a small reusable piece of content that you can use to build your site. In Reflex we have made it easy for you to build and theme components.

Creating and styling component is as easy as writing HTML.

<P fontSize="xl" fontWeight="semibold">
  If you know HTML you know how to use this.
</P>

Let's take a look.

### HTML to Components

In HTML, to create a button you use the `button` tag. In Reflex, you use `Button`. In HTML, to create a heading, you use `h1`, in Reflex you use `H1`. See what we did there?

Every HTML tag has an equivalent Reflex component. We have built components for almost all HTML tags.

## Build a button

Start with a simple `HTML` button.

<button>A button</button>

```html
<button>A button</button>
```

Let's turn this into a Reflex/React component.

<Button>A button</Button>

```jsx
<Button>A button</Button>
```

This is a button but with power!

## Style a button

Styling is a easy as adding attributes to the component, just like `HTML`.

<ThemeProvider>
  <Button bg="tomato">A button</Button>
</ThemeProvider>

```jsx
<Button bg="tomato">A button</Button>
```

Now turn this into a fancy button.

<Button
  background="tomato"
  color="white"
  px="4"
  py="3"
  fontSize="md"
  border="0"
  borderRadius="md"
  hoverBackground="purple"
>
  Fancy Button
</Button>

```js
<Button
  background="tomato"
  color="white"
  px="4"
  py="3"
  fontSize="md"
  border="0"
  borderRadius="md"
  hoverBackground="purple"
>
  Fancy Button
</Button>
```

That was easy. You are now ready to [build a hero](/docs/pages-style-hero).

**Note**: _Grid_, _Flexbox_, _Container_ and _Image_ are special components we added to Reflex. You can learn more about using images [here](/docs/images).
