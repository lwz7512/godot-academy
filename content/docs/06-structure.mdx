title: Directory Structure
excerpt: The base Reflex structure is intended to provide a great starting point for building your site.
---

However, Reflex imposes no restrictions on how you organize your content.

Every theme exposes a `contentPath` option that you can use to change where you place content files.

## Structure

```

### content

The _content_ directory contains all your site content. This is where you place your pages, blocks and images.

### blocks

The _blocks_ directory is for your re-usable blocks. Place your blocks here and reference them in your pages using the block name.

**Example**

`<Block src="name-of-block" />` is for a block at `content/blocks/name-of-block.mdx`.

<ButtonLink variant="muted sm" href="/docs/blocks">

</ButtonLink>

### images

The _images_ directory is for your images. Add your image files here and use the `Image` component to render them.

**Example**

`<Image src="name-of-image.png" />` will render an image placed at `content/images/name-of-image.png`.

<ButtonLink variant="muted sm" href="/docs/images">
  Learn more about images <Icon name="arrow-right" size="5" ml="2" />

### navs

The _navs_ directory is for navigation menus. Add your menus here and use the `NavMenu` component to place them in blocks or pages.

**Example**

`<NavMenu name="header" />` will render a nav placed at `content/navs/header.mdx`.

<ButtonLink variant="muted sm" href="/docs/navs">
  Learn more about navs <Icon name="arrow-right" size="5" ml="2" />
</ButtonLink>

### pages

This directory is where you place your pages. Every file placed in the _pages_ directory are automatically turned into pages with the page name as the slug.

**Example**

A page at `content/pages/example.mdx` will turned into a page with the `/example` path.

<ButtonLink variant="muted sm" href="/docs/pages">
  Learn more about pages <Icon name="arrow-right" size="5" ml="2" />
</ButtonLink>
