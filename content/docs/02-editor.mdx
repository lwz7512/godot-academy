## VS Code

ðŸ”§ 1. Enable Auto Save on `onFocuseChange`. 

```
  Settings / User tab / Text Editor / Files / Auto Save - onFocuseChange
```

ðŸ”§ 2. Enable Auto Reveal on File open, this is optional.

```
  Settings / User tab / Features / Explorer / Auto Reveal - true
```
  
This means each time you open a file, the left EXPLORER panel will scroll to focus file name.

ðŸ”‘ 3. Setup(unlock) Python program launch button

To run Python program in our universal code editor `VS Code`, we'll need create a `launch.json` file to let vscode know where to find our Python intepreter to run python code. This step would be covered in [Setup & First Game](/docs/arcade-install).

ðŸ”‘ 4. Setup(unlock) Lua program launch button

Like the Python program launch button, we also need a Lua program launch button. We achieve this by installing a VSCode called [love2d-made-easy](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=lwz7512.love2d-made-easy). This step would be covered in [Setup & First Game](/docs/love2d-install).
