## VS Code

1. Enable Auto Save on `onFocuseChange`. 

```
  Settings / User tab / Text Editor / Files / Auto Save - onFocuseChange
```

2. Enable Auto Reveal on File open, this is optional.

```
  Settings / User tab / Features / Explorer / Auto Reveal - true
```
  
this means each time you open a file, the left EXPLORER panel will scroll to focus file name.
